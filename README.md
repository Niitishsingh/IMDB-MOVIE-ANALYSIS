# IMDB-MOVIE-ANALYSIS
Project Description:
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the IMDB movie
dataset. The analysis focuses on several key aspects of the dataset, including movie genres,
duration, language, directors, and budget. By exploring these factors, we aim to understand
their impact on the IMDB scores and financial success of movies.

Approach:
To accomplish the project objectives, we followed a structured approach:
Data Preparation: I began by downloading the dataset provided for the project. The
dataset contains information about movie titles, genres, durations, languages,
directors, budgets, gross earnings, and IMDB scores. I conducted a data cleansing
activity and started working on this.
Data Analysis: Using Excel, we performed various analyses on the dataset to answer
the questions outlined in the project details. This involved manipulating the data to
extract relevant information, calculating descriptive statistics, and visualizing
relationships between different variables.
Report Generation: Based on the analysis results, we created a detailed report to
present our findings. The report includes insights derived from each analysis task,
supported by visualizations and statistical summaries.

Tech-Stack Used:
For this project, WPS Office for data analysis. Excel's built-in functions and tools were
instrumental in performing calculations, generating visualizations, and summarizing the
results. Additionally, we utilized Google Drive to save and share the final report.
